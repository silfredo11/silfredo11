### Hi, I am  Silfredo Ibarra 👋👩‍💻

I am a frontend developer in training, with the ability to work in a team, develop on already written code and understand what a good product is. I always want to make the best product possible. the technologies I work with are HTML, CSS, Git, and WSL. Also, I am learning JavaScript each day I study this technology for 3 hours. I am interested in learning about web development because that will allow me to contribute to the growth of humanity.
